# cities_socio-economic_clustering

### Introduction

Clustering helps to understand how data samples are related to each other.Clusters are composed by points that are similar to each other, but rela-tively different to the rest of points. Clustering methods do not need datalabels and therefore are calledunsupervised, as opposed to supervised onesthat we discussed in the previous exercises. In datasets where no labels areavailable, finding clusters of data points can help grouping the data sam-ples in a principled way

### Objective
To utilise the k-means algorithm by prototyping on asynthetic dataset, and then use it to find clusters of world cities based on some of their socio-economic statistics.  Analysis on the clusters will be done to characterise the different types of cities based on their clustering.
